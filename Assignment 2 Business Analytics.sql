Assignment 2: Business Analytics ASHTON SARLO :)

1. Create a new SQLite3 database named "USCensus.db".
2. Create three tables in the "USCensus.db" database:

- "Stats" with columns "Abb" (state abbreviation), "Area" (land area), and "Pop" (population).
- "Names" with columns "Abb" (state abbreviation) and "State" (full state name).
- "Capitals" with columns "State" (full state name), "Capital" (capital city), and "CapitalPop" (capital city population).

For each table, select the most appropriate data type for each column ("TEXT", "INTEGER", "REAL"), and choose the most appropriate
column as the primary key.

Part 2
Create a new SQLite3 database named "Superstore.db".
Open each provided file in a spreadsheet application or text editor to examine their contents. Identify the column names and data types.
